Jesus Christ's brothers and sisters were his real half siblings and their parents were Mary and Joseph. They were his half siblings because Jesus had a different father, but the same mother, Mary. They were not from another marriage of Joseph nor his cousins as the Catholic Church asserts. All of Jesus' brothers and sisters were from Joseph and Mary, no one else. Mary was not a perpetual virgin. She had sex many times and made children with Joseph who were Jesus Christ's half siblings after Jesus was born. Jesus is their big brother.
