Bliss is a deep, stable state of freedom from suffering, tied to awakening or liberation. Bliss is what you get when ignorance and craving fall away. Bliss means a state of ease, well-being, and contentment. The concept of nirvana is similar to bliss. Nirvana is the extinguishing of craving and ignorance that leads to ultimate happiness. Once you go beyond bliss to nirvana you are in a total state of bliss that never ends. Bliss can fluctuate due to causes or because certain conditions are present, but nirvana is permanent.
