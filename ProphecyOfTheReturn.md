So far Jesus has saved approximately 94,000,000 people. They are all living on Heaven in Andromeda waiting for their return. Jesus and the resurrected dead on Heaven will return to Earth in a ship after the 1000 years, around 3033 AD. The dimensions of the ship are in Revelation, but it is a disc, not a cube. The ship will hover with its center over Jerusalem and will cover a large portion of the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey.

Hosea 6:2 says, "2 After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence."

2 Peter 3:8 says, "8 But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day."

The Lord Jesus Christ was dead for three days and then was resurrected. He will be gone 3000 years before he returns. Like Hosea says, after 2000 years (two days), in 2033, he will revive the faith with Gregorian Christianity.
