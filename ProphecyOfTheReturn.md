So far Jesus has saved approximately 94,000,000 people. They are all living on Heaven in Andromeda waiting for their return. Jesus and the resurrected dead on Heaven will return to Earth in a ship after the 1000 years, around 3033 AD. The dimensions of the ship are in Revelation, but it is a disc, not a cube. The ship will hover with its center over Jerusalem and will cover a large portion of the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey.
