Gregorians believe in prayer, but you do not have to pray if you don't want to. Use it only for sick and/or poor people, not for yourself unless you want to pray for yourself. Use prayer for your family members if you want to. Start prayers by saying "Dear God and Dear Lord" and say what you want to happen or who you want to help, then end the prayer with "Amen."
