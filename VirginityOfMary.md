Churches such as the Catholic Church claim that Mary was a perpetual virgin. This is wrong. Scripture clearly states that Jesus had four brothers and multiple sisters. Mary was a virgin before she was artificially inseminated by God and birthed Jesus. After the virgin birth of Jesus, Mary had sex with Joseph frequently and had multiple children with Joseph. Since Mary was artificially inseminated with foreign semen, Jesus siblings are his half brothers and sisters. Mary was Jesus' blood mother, but Joseph was not Jesus' blood father.
