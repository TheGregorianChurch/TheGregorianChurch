Gregorians generally do not worship any of the Higher Order Beings, but if you choose to worship, worship The Most High God the Creator of the Infiniverse, but be warned, they probably have a creator too, so shouldn't you worship them instead? The Infiniverse is infinite. Our visible universe within the infiniverse is like a speck of sand within our universe. So, worship is arbitrary. It's an infinite system with infinite creators.
