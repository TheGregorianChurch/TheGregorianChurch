Adam and Eve were just two out of millions of humans about 5800 years ago. They were not the first two humans. They were not "created" like Moses asserted. They were both born and had parents. They were chosen by God to start the royal family of Earth.

By eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil they brought evil into this world so that we have knowledge of it. On other planets everything is perfect, but on Earth we have evil. The goal of this church is to completely eradicate evil on this planet now that we have knowledge of it and know what is just and good.
