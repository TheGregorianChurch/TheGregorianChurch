The Holy Spirit is the soul of Lord God Almighty. Jesus is an entirely different being and person. The real trinity is Lord God Almighty, Lord Jesus Christ, and the Lamb. The Lamb sits on a throne to God's left and Jesus sits on a throne to God's right. There are three humans who work together to rule the world and they are each individual beings with individual souls. This is the real trinity. The Catholic Church is wrong.
