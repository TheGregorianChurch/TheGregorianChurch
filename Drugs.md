Getting high on alcohol or anything else is not a sin, but it can lead to sin so one must be cautious. You must also be cautious because the Higher Order Beings do not permit everyone to get high. They may do things to mess with your life if you are one of those people. Some people are helped even more for getting high. It just depends on God's plan for you. Getting high is not for everyone.

It is a sin to imprison people for possession and use of alcohol or anything else.
