There was no flood over the entire earth around 4500 or so years ago. God did not kill all but eight humans. It's possible there was a local flood and Noah did gather only local animals, but animals like kangaroos and penguins were not on the ark. How would they have returned to Australia and Antarctica? Also, what did the predators eat when they got off the ark? They would have had to wait for their prey to reproduce many many times. It just doesn't make any sense. There would be extensive genetic evidence if all but eight humans died a few thousand years ago. There would be extensive evidence if every animal came from just two individuals a few thousand years ago. The entire notion of the story is ridiculous.
