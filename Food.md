Do not eat pets and do not eat people. Aside from that, we reject most religious food rules. Do not kill sacred animals like big cats and elephants and other endangered animals. Some animals were made by God to be food like chickens, turkeys, ducks, cows, pigs, deer, buffalo, fish, lamb, sheep, goat, shellfish, mollusks, goose, quail, pheasant, camel, elk, moose, caribou, . They are the ones we already eat.
