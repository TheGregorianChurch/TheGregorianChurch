Salvation is a gift from Jesus given to those who do good works for the him, the Lord. It is not immediate for everyone. For some people it can be a long, difficult process. Your level of salvation is directly correlated to your level of sin. Salvation is the deliverance from fundamentally negative and disabling conditions like suffering, evil, and pain which stem from sin. Eliminate sin from your life and you will be on the path to salvation.
