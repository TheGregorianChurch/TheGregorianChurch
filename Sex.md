Sex is an incredibly spiritual experience whether people recognize that or not. Couples should wait until marriage to have sex. Sex is not just for reproduction. It also serves as a bonding tool for couples keeping them intimate and close, which is important for a marriage. Premarital foreplay without sex can be explored by couples to guage compatability but is not necessary.
