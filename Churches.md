Gregorian Churches should not be places where one person preaches the gospel every week. They should be more like country clubs: just fun meeting places where people can get together and discuss the gospel and discuss what is happening. All priests of the Gregorian Church should function more as social workers than pastors. Churches should provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner for anyone whether they are a member or not. More affluent members should work with the priest to provide employment for the less affluent members. There should be a clear partnership between the church and corporations to provide employment channels. Churches should also provide free healthcare for anyone. Churches should be the center of civic life. Churches should be the town square. Everyone is an equal in the church. The priest is just the manager and facilitator.
