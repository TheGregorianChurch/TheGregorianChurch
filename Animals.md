Not all animals are created equal. The animals that have evolved pineal glands (most vertebrates), have souls. The animals that have not evolved pineal glands yet (all invertebrates and very few vertebrates), do not have souls. Animals with souls are able to live eternally through reincarnation. Animals without souls are essentially biological machines that the Higher Order Beings evolved and control for ecological tasks. We should eat our prey animals because a lot of starseeds come here and have to be chickens, then pigs, then turkeys, then cows, before they become humans. You never know which one is going to be a human, so we should eat them with thanksgiving.
