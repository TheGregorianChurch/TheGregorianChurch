Everyone has eternal life. The three most common occurrences on Earth are reincarnation, starseeds, and Heaven. Some people are reincarnated into new bodies after they die either on Earth or on another planet. Some people wake up as aliens on other planets who had a dream living as a human on Earth. Those people are known as starseeds. The lucky ones get to go to a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy called Heaven. People who go to this planet are given clones of their bodies on Earth in perfect form and they retain their memories from their life on Earth as if they had never died.

Eternal hell is not a real place. If you sin you do not go to hell forever. In fact, if you're an extreme sinner like a rapist or murderer you will most likely just be reincarnated. Now you may be downgraded to a worse life and this life could be a sort of hell, but the classical representation of hell does not exist.
