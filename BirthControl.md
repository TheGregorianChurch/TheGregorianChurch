Birth control is a gift from God to allow families to plan the births of their children while still maintaining close sexual relations with eachother for bonding. We encourage couples to use birth control to help plan their families.

Abortion is permitted before 120 days of being pregnant, for any reason. After 120 days, abortions should only be considered when the life of the child or mother is in jeopardy. Having an abortion is not murder and is not a sin if these guidelines are followed.
